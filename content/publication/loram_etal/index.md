abstract: "Ad hoc measurement of Climate change denial limits interpretability and integration of
research. This study aims to create a standardised measure of climate change denial using
Item Response Theory (IRT). A pool of candidate items was administered to a U.S. sample
recruited using Amazon MTurk (N = 206) along with measures of authoritarianism, social
dominance orientation, mistrust in scientists, and conspiracist beliefs. After screening out
poorly discriminating and redundant items, the scale contained eight items with high
discrimination indices and item difficulties ranged from 0.437 to 1.167. Internal consistency
was high, Ï‰ = .94. Moderate to strong correlations were found between the denial measure
and the convergent measures. The limited range of item difficulties suggests that different
forms of climate change denial may be closer together than previously thought."
