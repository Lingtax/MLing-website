Parents, teachers and healthcare providers are also increasingly using such interventions with children. This review examines the use of meditation-based interventions in the treatment of children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Electronic databases searched included PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, and AMED. Inclusion criteria involved children (aged to 18 years) diagnosed with ADHD, delivery of a meditation-based intervention to children and/or parents, and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Studies were identified and coded using standard criteria, risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies- of interventions (ROBINS-I), and effect sizes were calculated. A total of 16 studies were identified (8 that included children in treatment, and 8 that included combined parent-child treatment). Results indicated that risk of bias was high across studies. At this stage, no definitive conclusions can be offered regarding the utility of meditation-based interventions for children with ADHD and/or their parents, since the methodological quality of the studies reviewed is low. Future well designed research is needed to establish the efficacy of meditation-based interventions, including commonly used practices such as mindfulness, before recommendations can be made for children with ADHD and their families.","tags":["Misinformation","Vaccination"],"title":"Systematic review of meditation-based interventions for children with ADHD","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George Loram","Mathew Ling","Andrew Head","Edward Clarke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"ea805bfce175a8afd9ab9b3a39ea503c","permalink":"/publication/loram_etal/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/loram_etal/","section":"publication","summary":"Ad hoc measurement of Climate change denial limits interpretability and integration of research.

The STRAP-R (Sensitivity To Reinforcement of Addictive and other Primary Rewards) questionnaire was administered to 285 alcohol users (mean age=33.30, SD= 8.83) and 134 coffee users (mean age=33.05, SD=8.10) ranging in their levels of substance use to assess wanting and liking. Findings showed that in high risk alcohol users wanting may drive alcohol consumption more so than liking, compared with low risk alcohol users. However, wanting and liking did not significantly dissociate as alcohol consumption increased. These findings partially support IST. Additionally, IST was not supported in coffee users. It is possible that caffeine functions differently at the neurological level compared with alcohol, perhaps explaining the lack of dissociation emerging in coffee users as caffeine use increased. Nevertheless, the current study makes several contributions to IST research. Future studies should focus on utilising the STRAP-R with a clinically dependent sample to test the dissociation between wanting and liking.","tags":[""],"title":"Dissociation between wanting and liking for alcohol and caffeine: A test of the Incentive Sensitisation Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edward JR Clarke","Mathew Ling","Emily Kothe","Anna Klas","Ben Richardson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"f37cb51a5d94ad3b0c3ea7b404cc06c8","permalink":"/publication/clarke_etal_2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/clarke_etal_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Research consistently shows that right‐wing ideological adherents are more likely to deny climate change. However, less is known about how right‐wing ideological subtypes are uniquely related to climate change denial, as well as what explains these relationships. This study examines whether threat to the socioeconomic system in the form of climate change mitigation policies, referred to as Climate Change Mitigation Threat (CCMT), mediates the relationships between Right‐Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) subtypes and four forms of climate change denial (existence denial, human cause denial, impact denial and climate science denial). U.S. participants (N = 334; Mage = 34.70, SD = 5.98) were recruited via Amazon MTurk. When shared variance in the predictors was accounted for, we found that: (a) Conventionalism (RWA‐C) positively predicted all forms of climate change denial; (b) Dominance (SDO‐D) positively predicted existence denial; (c) Anti‐Egalitarianism (SDO‐E) positively predicted both human cause and impact denial; and (d) Aggression (RWA‐A) negatively predicted existence denial. All significant direct relationships were partially mediated by CCMT, except for the direct paths between SDO‐D and existence denial, and RWA‐A and existence denial. These findings suggest that right‐wing adherents who conform to societal norms and prefer unequal social systems may deny climate change partly due to a perception that mitigation strategies proposed to combat climate change threaten the existing socioeconomic system.","tags":[""],"title":"Mitigation system threat partially mediates the effects of right-wing ideologies on climate change beliefs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ben Richardson","Matthew Fuller-Tyszkiewicz","Renée O'Donnell","Mathew Ling","Petra Staiger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"470dba7d51a444a86b5578ce083fae27","permalink":"/publication/richardson_etal_2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/richardson_etal_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"An increasingly popular form of data collection in health psychology research is Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA); that is, using diaries or smartphones to collect intensive longitudinal data. This method is increasingly applied to the study of relationships between state-based aspects of individuals’ functioning and health outcomes (e.g., binge eating, alcohol use). Analysis of such data is challenging and regression tree modelling (RTM) may be a useful alternative to multilevel modelling for investigating the association between a set of explanatory variables and a continuous outcome. Furthermore, RTM outputs ‘decision trees’ that could be used by health practitioners to guide assessment and tailor intervention. In contrast to regression, RTM is able to easily accommodate many complex, higher-order interactions between predictor variables (without the need to create explicit interaction terms). These benefits make the technique useful for those interested in monitoring and intervening upon health and psychological outcomes (e.g., mood, eating behaviour, risky alcohol use, and treatment adherence). Using real data, this paper demonstrates both the benefits and limitations of RTM and how to extend these models to accommodate analysis of nested data; that is, data that arise from EMA where repeated observations are nested within individuals.","tags":[""],"title":"Regression tree analysis of ecological momentary assessment data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shujuan Liu","David Mellor","Mathew Ling","José L Saiz","Eugenia Vinet","Xiaoyan Xu","Solomon Renati","Linda Byrne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491523200,"objectID":"81b214379d8ed702111fcdbcd75e9de6","permalink":"/publication/liu_etal_2017/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu_etal_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief (SPQ-B) is a commonly-used tool for measuring schizotypal personality traits and due to its wide application, its cross-cultural validity is of interest. Previous studies suggest that the SPQ-B either has a three- or four-factor structure, but the majority of studies have been conducted in Western contexts and little is known about the psychometric properties of the scale in other populations. In this study factorial invariance testing across three cultural contexts-Australia, China and Chile was conducted. In total, 729 young adults (Mean age = 23.99 years, SD = 9.87 years) participated. Invariance testing did not support the four-factor model across three countries. Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed that neither the four- nor three-factor model had strong fit in any of the settings. However, in comparison with other competing models, the four-factor model showed the best for the Australian sample, while the three-factor model was the most reasonable for both Chinese and Chilean samples. The reliability of the SPQ-B scores, estimated with Omega, ranged from 0.86 to 0.91. These findings suggest that the SPQ-B factors are not consistent across different cultural groups. We suggest that these differences could be attributed to potential confounding cultural and translation issues.","tags":["Psychometrics"],"title":"The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief lacks measurement invariance across three countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"While many questions within psychological research involve the variation in behaviour within individuals between contexts, many traditional designs are insensitive to these phenomena.

While the progenitors of the widely utilised self-report scale describe the construct as reflecting individual differences in the tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognition, there is no consensus on the specific motivation underpinning these differences. A clear model of this individual difference would allow for accurate prediction of the conditions under which this tendency is most strongly manifest, but also how it might be promoted. This thesis seeks to develop a more complete representation of what it is to vary in NFC though systematic review of the literature regarding the NFC scale’s dimensionality; empirical evaluation of the factorial structure of the NFC scale in two samples; and examination of the proximate behavioural products of NFC in both lab settings and ecological contexts.\nThrough evaluation of the literature it was found that while the measure is generally treated as unidimensional, there is a trend for studies using true factor analysis methodologies finding multifactorial solutions. However, within studies using these, no consistent factorial solution was found, possibly due to methodological variation between these studies.\nTo address this, factor analysis was conducted on the full-length scale in two independent samples using consistent methodology. As such, consistency (or lack thereof) in the factorial solutions derived in the two samples should reflect either the presence of replicable factors or demonstrate that previously observed multifactorial solutions are a function of incomplete optimisation of the NFC scale. Results favoured the latter, suggesting that there is one replicable factor in the NFC scale reflecting tendency to engage in effortful cognition; this duly did not provide insight into the drivers of this behaviour.\nFurther insight into the motivation underpinning NFC was sought, specifically evaluating the model of NFC as differences in enjoyment of the process of effortful cognition. In a controlled (lab) setting, NFC was shown to not be associated with either the persistence with puzzle tasks or enjoyment of educational videos, suggesting that the impact of NFC on engagement might not be as universal as would be expected if it indexed the degree to which effortful cognition was intrinsically enjoyable.\nTo obtain a better understanding of NFC outside of lab settings, an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) study was undertaken, examining the frequency and quality of engagement in effortful cognition in real-world contexts. This further permitted the validation of the prior study’s findings. The results of this study show that the NFC scale predicts engagement in effortful cognition in ecological settings, but none of the enjoyment thereof, effort invested, or the attribution to internal causes, despite there being individual differences in tendency for these latter outcomes.\nThis program of research therefore is able to conclude that the 18-item short form scale is better considered as an optimised measure, where the longer measures are liable to include additional error. Further, while individual differences exist in the tendency to engage in effortful cognition, the enjoyment thereof, as well as the investment of effort and attribution bias for this engagement, the NFC scale only predicts engagement. While these results particularly do not support the enjoyment of process account of intrinsic motivation in NFC, more broadly they suggest that differences in behaviour associated with NFC may be driven by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Potential avenues for promoting effortful cognition remain through the increased exposure to complex cognitive tasks.\n","date":1459987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459987200,"objectID":"ccc043028697685c3225605be28ba21a","permalink":"/publication/ling_2016/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ling_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"This thesis investigated the measurement of differences between people in tendency to engage in effortful thought.
