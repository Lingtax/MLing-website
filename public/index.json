One hundred and forty-seven women completed a baseline measure of trait body image flexibility, followed by a 7-day ecological momentary assessment phase in which participants self-reported state body dissatisfaction, disordered eating behavior, drive for thinness, and appearance comparisons at 10 semi-random intervals daily. Higher trait body image flexibility predicted lower average scores, less frequent reporting of high state body dissatisfaction, and less variability in their state body dissatisfaction ratings. Individuals with higher trait body image flexibility were also less likely to engage in a range of behaviors and cognitions previously shown to produce body dissatisfaction, including upward appearance comparisons, drive for thinness, binge eating, and dieting. However, few of these state-based relationships involving body dissatisfaction and these related behaviors and cognitions were moderated by trait body image flexibility. Overall, this pattern of findings suggests that body image flexible individuals may have less negative body image because they are less inclined to engage in behaviors and cognitions in their daily lives that encourage negative body image.","tags":null,"title":"Trait body image flexibility as a predictor of body image states in everyday life of young Australian women","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathew Ling"],"categories":[],"content":" Trigger Warnings: Mass transit, Air catastrophes, Open science\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about methodological reform in the sciences (in general) and psychology (in specific) a lot lately. Much of my thinking is indebted to Danielle Navarro\u0026rsquo;s, so really you\u0026rsquo;re better off going and reading her posts honestly\u0026hellip; but anyhow. An analogy recently got wedged in my head and this is how I\u0026rsquo;m choosing to get it out.\nImagine, for the moment that our scientific endeavour is a plane. Regrettably, sometimes things go wrong with planes. This might be because of simple wear-and-tear or defective parts, neglect and carelessness, and sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s because there are malign incentives for people to harm our plane. However it comes about doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter, it only matters how we act after we discover this problem that really makes a difference. Someone needs to do something, because Superman is not coming.\nNow when something goes wrong in an airplane (i.e. a discipline), there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance most passengers (scholars) won\u0026rsquo;t even realise. Even when people do realise, there\u0026rsquo;s mostly nothing that you (jammed in cattle class between a screaming child and a person who has no demonstrable understanding of personal space) can do to appreciably fix this problem. If an engine fails, or a window pops out causing a decompression of the cabin, really it\u0026rsquo;s up to the team that have been doing upkeep on the plane (publishers), the pilots (journal editors), and the air traffic controllers (funding bodies) to have any meaningful impact on how bad this situation ends up getting1. Does the plane land and lead to investigation and process reforms? Or does it crash in a firey cataclysm that takes you and your fellow passengers into retirement? Let\u0026rsquo;s be assured that you\u0026rsquo;re not helping from 62F, and if you do try to help land the plane, or even just try to inform everyone about the status of the plane what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is not helping. There is no place for heroes in Economy class.\nBut, as the rumbles and thuds issue through the plane and the air starts leaking out of the plane, masks descend from the overhead compartment, and if you were paying attention to the safety briefing you\u0026rsquo;ll know what you have to do next.\n Pull down on the mask, pull it over your face, tighten the strap, and importantly secure your mask before helping those around you.\n There are some very good reasons for this instruction, in the context of a decompression you are likely to lose coordination and consciousness before you can help someone else and then fix your own self. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider that instruction for a moment.\nFirst, we must care for ourselves. Obviously there\u0026rsquo;s a self-care / welfare interpretation, and that should matter too, but let\u0026rsquo;s also consider the importance of focussing on our own problems. Assuming the \u0026ldquo;people in charge\u0026rdquo; get this plane on the ground safely, it isn\u0026rsquo;t going to help you if you\u0026rsquo;ve been flung against the cabin roof like a ragdoll because you didn\u0026rsquo;t have your seatbelt secured tightly around your waist; and your head has been clobbered against the seat in front, because you didn\u0026rsquo;t adopt your brace position; and you\u0026rsquo;ve asphyxiated because you were too busy telling everyone how bad it all was instead of putting your mask on. Even with systemic changes, your survival is in your hands and you should ensure you\u0026rsquo;re doing everything you can on that front. Think about what you could be doing now to make your position better, listen to the cabin crew (i.e. people like statisticians or modelling experts who are specialists in the tools you depend on) when they\u0026rsquo;re telling you about the safety features, especially if you think you already know, and then take actions to improve your position.\nBut then, once you are certain you\u0026rsquo;re doing what you can to get your house in order, take note of the implicit instruction in the second half \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;before helping those around you\u0026rdquo;. This isn\u0026rsquo;t negotiable, you are obliged to help those around you. But we owe it to be gentle with those going through this situation2, because it\u0026rsquo;s not something we ever prepared ourselves for, and we all need help getting ready for landing wherever the \u0026ldquo;people in charge\u0026rdquo; take us. If circumstances have resulted in them being less prepared for this situation than you, and your first urge is to tell them they\u0026rsquo;re bad people for not putting on their masks, get in the sea.\n\u0026ldquo;You should have been listening during the safety briefing, Janet!\u0026rdquo;\nFinally, once we get this plane on the ground (or maybe if you\u0026rsquo;re waiting for your flight) when you hear about another plane in trouble, maybe we can start wondering why air travel doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem safe anymore and seeing if we can do something about that. Eventually they\u0026rsquo;re going to call boarding on your next flight, and you would want other people calling for broader reform rather than calling you out for your choice of carrier, the seat you chose, and what survival gear you packed.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Quiet parts\u0026rdquo; out loud In case you want the short version without the gratious analogy, here it is.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how we got here, just how we get out of here, and prevent being here again.\nThere are no saviours. Anyone making themselves out to be a saviour should be treated with the same level of kind caution as you would provide to someone claiming to be the messiah in the local hardware store.\nEditors, Publishers, and Funders need to solve this, because it\u0026rsquo;s their goddamn jobs. We have publication bias because of them; If funders prioritised reproducibility, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t live in this timeline. If they broke it, they should fix it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be an arsehole. Did we really need to say this? It sadly seems so.\nFix yourself first. Spend the time to learn what you could be doing better, work on that first and foremost.\nHelp those around you. When you have your house in order, gently offer help outwards to the people nearest. We all end up as prepared as we are, and you\u0026rsquo;re not helping anyone by giving them shit. If we all give kindness to those in the seats beside us, maybe we can all survive this episode without anyone ending up handcuffed in the toilet.\nBe kind to other scholars, and start reforming the system.

Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), a widely applied model of motivation to respond to threats, may provide some insights into strategies to increase the rate of vaccine uptake. Yet, previous research has omitted some of the proposed predictors of intention when applying this model to vaccination.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to assess the utility of the PMT in predicting intention to obtain the seasonal influenza vaccine. This study will be the first to examine the role of all six PMT constructs in predicting intention to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine.\nMETHOD: A cross-sectional study of 547 US residents was conducted using Amazon MTurk.\nRESULTS: All constructs show significant bivariate correlations in the direction expected from the prior literature. Further examination of the theory within a linear regression model, however, found that perceived costs of vaccinating (i.e., response costs) did not uniquely account for variance in intention. All other components, perceived severity of and susceptibility to influenza, the perceived benefits of not vaccinating (i.e., maladaptive response rewards), the self-efficacy to vaccinate, and the perceived efficacy of vaccinating in preventing influenza (i.e., response efficacy) were unique predictors of intention. Overall, the PMT accounted for 62% of the variance in intention to vaccinate.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study is the first to investigate influenza vaccination using all six theorised predictors of intention from the PMT. The findings highlight the importance of the simultaneous inclusion of all components of the model in assessing their potential utility as targets for intervention. Importantly, the results identify under-utilised constructs in the promotion of vaccine uptake, such as maladaptive response rewards, which should be considered targets for future intervention.","tags":["misinformation","Vaccination"],"title":"Predicting intention to receive a seasonal influenza vaccination using Protection Motivation Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Subhadra Evans","Mathew Ling","Briony Hill","Nicole Rinehart","David Austin","Emma Sciberras"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"b572b7ff05c261b2e33ffb625d72e12d","permalink":"/publication/evans_etal_2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/evans_etal_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Meditation-based interventions such as mindfulness and yoga are commonly practiced in the general community to improve mental and physical health.

This review examines the use of meditation-based interventions in the treatment of children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Electronic databases searched included PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, and AMED. Inclusion criteria involved children (aged to 18 years) diagnosed with ADHD, delivery of a meditation-based intervention to children and/or parents, and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Studies were identified and coded using standard criteria, risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies- of interventions (ROBINS-I), and effect sizes were calculated. A total of 16 studies were identified (8 that included children in treatment, and 8 that included combined parent-child treatment). Results indicated that risk of bias was high across studies. At this stage, no definitive conclusions can be offered regarding the utility of meditation-based interventions for children with ADHD and/or their parents, since the methodological quality of the studies reviewed is low. Future well designed research is needed to establish the efficacy of meditation-based interventions, including commonly used practices such as mindfulness, before recommendations can be made for children with ADHD and their families.","tags":["Misinformation","Vaccination"],"title":"Systematic review of meditation-based interventions for children with ADHD","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George Loram","Mathew Ling","Andrew Head","Edward Clarke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"ea805bfce175a8afd9ab9b3a39ea503c","permalink":"/publication/loram_etal/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/loram_etal/","section":"publication","summary":"Ad hoc measurement of Climate change denial limits interpretability and integration of research.

The aim of this study is to test the dissociation between wanting and liking in humans across two commonly used licit substances, alcohol and caffeine. The STRAP-R (Sensitivity To Reinforcement of Addictive and other Primary Rewards) questionnaire was administered to 285 alcohol users (mean age=33.30, SD= 8.83) and 134 coffee users (mean age=33.05, SD=8.10) ranging in their levels of substance use to assess wanting and liking. Findings showed that in high risk alcohol users wanting may drive alcohol consumption more so than liking, compared with low risk alcohol users. However, wanting and liking did not significantly dissociate as alcohol consumption increased. These findings partially support IST. Additionally, IST was not supported in coffee users. It is possible that caffeine functions differently at the neurological level compared with alcohol, perhaps explaining the lack of dissociation emerging in coffee users as caffeine use increased. Nevertheless, the current study makes several contributions to IST research. Future studies should focus on utilising the STRAP-R with a clinically dependent sample to test the dissociation between wanting and liking.","tags":[""],"title":"Dissociation between wanting and liking for alcohol and caffeine: A test of the Incentive Sensitisation Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edward JR Clarke","Mathew Ling","Emily Kothe","Anna Klas","Ben Richardson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"f37cb51a5d94ad3b0c3ea7b404cc06c8","permalink":"/publication/clarke_etal_2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/clarke_etal_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Research consistently shows that right‐wing ideological adherents are more likely to deny climate change. However, less is known about how right‐wing ideological subtypes are uniquely related to climate change denial, as well as what explains these relationships. This study examines whether threat to the socioeconomic system in the form of climate change mitigation policies, referred to as Climate Change Mitigation Threat (CCMT), mediates the relationships between Right‐Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) subtypes and four forms of climate change denial (existence denial, human cause denial, impact denial and climate science denial). U.S. participants (N = 334; Mage = 34.70, SD = 5.98) were recruited via Amazon MTurk. When shared variance in the predictors was accounted for, we found that: (a) Conventionalism (RWA‐C) positively predicted all forms of climate change denial; (b) Dominance (SDO‐D) positively predicted existence denial; (c) Anti‐Egalitarianism (SDO‐E) positively predicted both human cause and impact denial; and (d) Aggression (RWA‐A) negatively predicted existence denial. All significant direct relationships were partially mediated by CCMT, except for the direct paths between SDO‐D and existence denial, and RWA‐A and existence denial. These findings suggest that right‐wing adherents who conform to societal norms and prefer unequal social systems may deny climate change partly due to a perception that mitigation strategies proposed to combat climate change threaten the existing socioeconomic system.","tags":["misinformation"],"title":"Mitigation system threat partially mediates the effects of right-wing ideologies on climate change beliefs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ben Richardson","Matthew Fuller-Tyszkiewicz","Renée O'Donnell","Mathew Ling","Petra Staiger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"470dba7d51a444a86b5578ce083fae27","permalink":"/publication/richardson_etal_2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/richardson_etal_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"An increasingly popular form of data collection in health psychology research is Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA); that is, using diaries or smartphones to collect intensive longitudinal data. This method is increasingly applied to the study of relationships between state-based aspects of individuals’ functioning and health outcomes (e.g., binge eating, alcohol use). Analysis of such data is challenging and regression tree modelling (RTM) may be a useful alternative to multilevel modelling for investigating the association between a set of explanatory variables and a continuous outcome. Furthermore, RTM outputs ‘decision trees’ that could be used by health practitioners to guide assessment and tailor intervention. In contrast to regression, RTM is able to easily accommodate many complex, higher-order interactions between predictor variables (without the need to create explicit interaction terms). These benefits make the technique useful for those interested in monitoring and intervening upon health and psychological outcomes (e.g., mood, eating behaviour, risky alcohol use, and treatment adherence). Using real data, this paper demonstrates both the benefits and limitations of RTM and how to extend these models to accommodate analysis of nested data; that is, data that arise from EMA where repeated observations are nested within individuals.","tags":[""],"title":"Regression tree analysis of ecological momentary assessment data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shujuan Liu","David Mellor","Mathew Ling","José L Saiz","Eugenia Vinet","Xiaoyan Xu","Solomon Renati","Linda Byrne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491523200,"objectID":"81b214379d8ed702111fcdbcd75e9de6","permalink":"/publication/liu_etal_2017/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu_etal_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief (SPQ-B) is a commonly-used tool for measuring schizotypal personality traits and due to its wide application, its cross-cultural validity is of interest.

In this study factorial invariance testing across three cultural contexts-Australia, China and Chile was conducted. In total, 729 young adults (Mean age = 23.99 years, SD = 9.87 years) participated. Invariance testing did not support the four-factor model across three countries. Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed that neither the four- nor three-factor model had strong fit in any of the settings. However, in comparison with other competing models, the four-factor model showed the best for the Australian sample, while the three-factor model was the most reasonable for both Chinese and Chilean samples. The reliability of the SPQ-B scores, estimated with Omega, ranged from 0.86 to 0.91. These findings suggest that the SPQ-B factors are not consistent across different cultural groups.

While the progenitors of the widely utilised self-report scale describe the construct as reflecting individual differences in the tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognition, there is no consensus on the specific motivation underpinning these differences. A clear model of this individual difference would allow for accurate prediction of the conditions under which this tendency is most strongly manifest, but also how it might be promoted. This thesis seeks to develop a more complete representation of what it is to vary in NFC though systematic review of the literature regarding the NFC scale’s dimensionality; empirical evaluation of the factorial structure of the NFC scale in two samples; and examination of the proximate behavioural products of NFC in both lab settings and ecological contexts.\nThrough evaluation of the literature it was found that while the measure is generally treated as unidimensional, there is a trend for studies using true factor analysis methodologies finding multifactorial solutions. However, within studies using these, no consistent factorial solution was found, possibly due to methodological variation between these studies.\nTo address this, factor analysis was conducted on the full-length scale in two independent samples using consistent methodology. As such, consistency (or lack thereof) in the factorial solutions derived in the two samples should reflect either the presence of replicable factors or demonstrate that previously observed multifactorial solutions are a function of incomplete optimisation of the NFC scale. Results favoured the latter, suggesting that there is one replicable factor in the NFC scale reflecting tendency to engage in effortful cognition; this duly did not provide insight into the drivers of this behaviour.\nFurther insight into the motivation underpinning NFC was sought, specifically evaluating the model of NFC as differences in enjoyment of the process of effortful cognition. In a controlled (lab) setting, NFC was shown to not be associated with either the persistence with puzzle tasks or enjoyment of educational videos, suggesting that the impact of NFC on engagement might not be as universal as would be expected if it indexed the degree to which effortful cognition was intrinsically enjoyable.\nTo obtain a better understanding of NFC outside of lab settings, an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) study was undertaken, examining the frequency and quality of engagement in effortful cognition in real-world contexts. This further permitted the validation of the prior study’s findings. The results of this study show that the NFC scale predicts engagement in effortful cognition in ecological settings, but none of the enjoyment thereof, effort invested, or the attribution to internal causes, despite there being individual differences in tendency for these latter outcomes.\nThis program of research therefore is able to conclude that the 18-item short form scale is better considered as an optimised measure, where the longer measures are liable to include additional error. Further, while individual differences exist in the tendency to engage in effortful cognition, the enjoyment thereof, as well as the investment of effort and attribution bias for this engagement, the NFC scale only predicts engagement. While these results particularly do not support the enjoyment of process account of intrinsic motivation in NFC, more broadly they suggest that differences in behaviour associated with NFC may be driven by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Potential avenues for promoting effortful cognition remain through the increased exposure to complex cognitive tasks.\n","date":1459987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459987200,"objectID":"ccc043028697685c3225605be28ba21a","permalink":"/publication/ling_2016/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ling_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"This thesis investigated the measurement of differences between people in tendency to engage in effortful thought.
