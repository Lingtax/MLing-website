      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many questions within psychological research involve the variation in behaviour within individuals between contexts, many traditional designs are insensitive to these phenomena. This stream of research examines behaviours in ecological contexts through the use of high frequency repeated measures designs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research project (PhD) sought to understand the nature of individual differences in Need for Cognition. In pursuit of this aim, this project had a psychometric emphasis, involving factor analysis, scale validation, and Ecological Momentary Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Research Practices</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open and reproducible research practices are those that make more of both the process and products of research available to the broader community. These include the sharing of materials, data, and analytic code, the open access publication of research manuscripts, the use of open source tools, and the open documentation of decision-making in the research process (e.g.  open notebooks or preregistration). The engagement with these practices can maximise the benefits of work already conducted, minimise research waste, increase the trustworthiness of research, and improve the collegiality of the research environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Susceptibility to Misinformation</title>
      <link>/project/misinformationroots/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While misinformation affects society broadly, its impacts are not homogenously distributed, with some individuals being more susceptible to its effects. This program of research aims to identify the factors that make an individual susceptible or resistant to misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
