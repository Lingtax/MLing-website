&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger Warnings: Mass transit, Air catastrophes, Open science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about methodological reform in the sciences (in general) and psychology (in specific) a lot lately. Much of my thinking is indebted to &lt;a href=&#34;https://djnavarro.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Danielle Navarro&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, so really you&amp;rsquo;re better off going and reading her posts honestly&amp;hellip; but anyhow. An analogy recently got wedged in my head and this is how I&amp;rsquo;m choosing to get it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our scientific endeavour sometimes seems like a plane, and sometimes things go wrong with planes. This might be because of &lt;a href=&#34;https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;simple wear-and-tear of aging parts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/DPlab/papers/publishedPapers/Simmons_2011_False-Positive%20Psychology.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;neglect and carelessness&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s because there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2011/12/diederik-stapel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;malign incentives for people to harm our plane&lt;/a&gt;. However it comes about doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter, it only matters how we act after we discover this problem that really makes a difference. Someone needs to do something, because superman is not coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in an airplane if something goes wrong there&amp;rsquo;s a chance most people won&amp;rsquo;t even realise. Even when people do realise, there&amp;rsquo;s mostly nothing that you (jammed in cattle class between a screaming child and a person who has no demonstrable understanding of personal space) can do to appreciably fix this problem. If an engine fails, or a window pops out causing a decompression of the cabin, really it&amp;rsquo;s up to the team that have been doing upkeep on the plane (publishers), the pilots (journal editors), and the air traffic controllers (funding bodies) to have any meaningful impact on how bad this situation ends up getting&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:bignote&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:bignote&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Does the plane land and lead to investigation and process reforms? Or does it crash in a firey cataclism that takes you and your fellow passengers into retirement? Let&amp;rsquo;s be assured that you&amp;rsquo;re not helping from 62F, and if you do try to help land the plane, or even just try to inform everyone about the status of the plane &lt;em&gt;what you&amp;rsquo;re doing is not helping&lt;/em&gt;. There is no place for heroes in Economy class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as the rumbles and thuds issue through the plane and the air starts leaking out of the plane, masks descend from the overhead compartment, and if you were paying attention to the safety briefing you&amp;rsquo;ll know what you have to do next. &lt;strong&gt;Pull down on the mask, pull it over your face, tighten the strap, and importantly &lt;em&gt;Secure your mask before helping those around you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There are some very good reasons for this instruction, in the context of a decompression, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUfF2MTnqAw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;you are likely to lose coordination and consciousness before you can help someone else and then fix your own self&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider that instruction for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we must care for ourselves. Obviously there&amp;rsquo;s a self-care interpretation, and that should matter too, but let&amp;rsquo;s also consider the importance of focussing on our own problems. Assuming the &amp;ldquo;people in charge&amp;rdquo; get this plane on the ground safely, it isn&amp;rsquo;t going to help you if you&amp;rsquo;ve been flung against the cabin roof like a ragdoll because you didn&amp;rsquo;t have your seatbelt secured tightly around your waist; and your head has been clobbered against the seat in front, because you didn&amp;rsquo;t adopt your brace position; and you&amp;rsquo;ve asphyxiated because you were too busy telling everyone how bad it all was instead of putting your mask on. Even with systemic changes, your survival is in your hands and you should spend time on ensuring you&amp;rsquo;re doing everything you can on that front. Think about what you could be doing now to make your position better, &lt;em&gt;listen to the cabin crew&lt;/em&gt; when they&amp;rsquo;re telling you about the safety features, &lt;em&gt;especially if you think you already know&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, once you are &lt;a href=&#34;https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-3.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;certain you&amp;rsquo;re doing what you can to get your house in order&lt;/a&gt;, take note of the implicit instruction in the second half of that instruction &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;before helping those around you&amp;rdquo;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t negotiable, you are obliged to help those around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;quiet-parts-out-loud&#34;&gt;Quiet parts out loud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how we got here&lt;/em&gt; just how we prevent being here again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are no saviours.&lt;/em&gt; Anyone making themselves out to be a savour should be treated with the same level of kind caution as you would provide to someone claiming to be the messiah in the local hardware stroe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editors, Publishers, and Funders need to solve this, because it&amp;rsquo;s their goddamn jobs.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be an arsehole&lt;/em&gt;. Did we really need to say this? It sadly seems so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fix yourself first&lt;/em&gt;. Spend the time to learn what you could be doing better, work on that first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Help those around you&lt;/em&gt;. When you have your house in order, offer help outwards to the people nearest. If we all give kindness to those in the seats beside us, maybe we can all survive this episode without anyone ending up handcuffed in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be kind to other scholars, and start reforming the system&lt;/em&gt;. It might not be you now, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it won&amp;rsquo;t ever be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:bignote&#34;&gt;Lest this piece be taken as a lionisation of powerful others (i.e. funders, editors, and publishers), let me remind you that it is &lt;em&gt;literally the job&lt;/em&gt; of engineers, mechanics, pilots and air traffic controllers to ensure planes land safely. If planes were dropping out of the sky, the public would be well within it&amp;rsquo;s rights to ask why these people were keeping their jobs, and why the processes aren&amp;rsquo;t being improved. They would not be within their rights to blame the passenger in 55B for not saving everyone, and really they ought to cut 55B some slack if they needed some help.

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
